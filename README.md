Hardware Setup:

Connect the L298N motor driver to your Arduino according to its datasheet and the motor driver module's pinout. Typically, you will connect:
Motor power supply (Vcc) to an external power source
GND pin of the motor driver to the ground (GND) of the Arduino.
IN1, IN2, IN3, and IN4 pins of the motor driver to digital output pins of the Arduino.
Motor terminals to the motor driver's output terminals (OUT1, OUT2 for one motor and OUT3, OUT4 for the other).
Ensure that the motor driver and motors are properly connected and secured.
Software Setup:

Install the necessary library for controlling the L298N motor driver (if any).
Write the Arduino code to control the speed of the motors.
